# 3.1.0 - 2016-03-12

- Added: `--skip-test`, because you might need it for shitty test runner

  _Recommended Usage: `npm test && npmpub --skip-test`._

  corresponding section in your changelog.
- Added: `--help` to see the help
- Added: `--verbose` to see some informations.
- Added: `--debug` to see all informations about process.
- Added: `--skip-status` to skip git status check

# 2.0.0 - 2016-01-11
